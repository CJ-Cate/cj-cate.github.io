All blogs start somewhere. This one starts here! To solve the simple issue of "needing content" for a blog, why not put down some simple documentation while I am creating this blog. Whether or not this is placeholder or will stay up (or be updated for big blog updates) is to be determined.

The scope for v1 is very simple: Create a static site with a main page that links to blog pages of plaintext.
